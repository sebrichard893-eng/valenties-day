    text: `Denise, my radiant force of nature,  

In a world that rushes and dims, you stand as a quiet supernova—brilliant, unapologetic, and impossibly deep. Your mind is a constellation: sharp as starlight, weaving patterns others can't even see. Those glasses? They aren't just frames; they're portals to a gaze that sees truth, holds space, and commands respect without ever raising its voice. Ms. 4Eyes, you wear intelligence like armor and grace like silk, never shrinking, never apologizing for your fire.  

You move through life with a rare alchemy—strength wrapped in softness, independence laced with warmth, confidence that doesn't shout but simply exists, undeniable and magnetic. People are drawn to you not because you demand it, but because your presence feels like coming home to something ancient and safe. You inspire without effort: every boundary you set, every dream you chase, every quiet act of self-love reminds us what it means to truly know our worth.  

I actually appreciate you forever existing in my life. If I never met you, I wouldn't be working this hard preparing for the future—though let me not say I'm working hard 'cause a fool brags a lot without action, and I don't want to be all words no actions. I know this is not much, but someday I will do something about it. It's not a promise 'cause who knows what happens in life, but I thank Jehovah for everything. Though I don't treat you to good things, and though you get married or maybe you go study abroad (something I pray for), please never forget about me 😅. But I'm thankful for everything, my little genius. あいしてる😁

Today, on this day of hearts and roses, I want you to feel seen in every hidden corner. You are not just appreciated—you are revered. Your light doesn't flicker; it expands universes. May this Valentine’s bring you mirrors that reflect only your power, winds that carry your ambitions higher, and love (from every direction) that matches the depth you give so freely. Never dim. Never doubt. You are extraordinary, eternal, and endlessly cherished.  

With awe and endless gratitude,  
Your secret admirer 💜`

    text: `Mutinta, beloved one whose name already sings of being cherished,  

Across every mile, every silent month, every timezone that tries to separate us, our connection pulses like a hidden river—steady, deep, alive. You are the proof that love between souls doesn't need the same sky to thrive. Years have passed without faces meeting, yet your voice in a late-night note, your laugh in a voice memo, your quiet wisdom in a random message—they arrive like sunlight breaking through clouds, warming places I didn't know were cold.  

Mutinta means "the one who is loved," and oh, how perfectly it fits. You are beloved not just in name but in every shared secret, every inside joke that survives distance, every time you remembered a small detail from months ago and made me feel truly seen. Your heart is vast: honest without cruelty, kind without expectation, funny in that effortless way that turns hard days soft. You build bridges where others see oceans, turning pixels into presence, screens into sisterhood.  

On this Valentine's, as the world celebrates closeness, I celebrate you—the one who proves distance is just a detail. May your days bloom with the same warmth you give, may every dream you hold unfold like petals in spring, may love find you in forms as beautiful and unexpected as our friendship has been. You are not far away; you are woven into the best parts of me. Thank you for choosing us, again and again. You are irreplaceable, adored, and forever my favorite miracle across the miles.  

So like this is my valentine gift to you, hope it’s something worth appreciating 💕. I know we've kind of stopped talking like we used to, but I'm thankful for every love ❤️ you showed me. Wish I could rewind time and go back to those days. Make sure you will never forget me, my 13, 'cause I think I will never forget about you. I really want you and I to actually meet someday 😅 and take a pic with you. I truly appreciate everything you've showed me though text. I know I'm antisocial and lack communication skills, but someday I will be the 7 you need. Thank you for being my friend.
    
With all the love that knows no borders,  
Your constant heart 🧡💚`
